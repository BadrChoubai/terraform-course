## Air-Gapped Environments

An "Air Gap" is a network security measure employed on one or more computers
to ensure that a secure computer network is physically isolated from unsecure
networks.

Industries in the Public Sector (Government and Military) or Large Enterprise
(Energy and Finance) often employ air gap networks.
